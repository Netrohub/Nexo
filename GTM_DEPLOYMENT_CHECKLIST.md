## 🎯 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Create GTM Container

1. Go to [Google Tag Manager](https://tagmanager.google.com/)
2. Click "Create Account"
3. Enter:
   - **Account Name:** NXOLand
   - **Country:** Your country
   - **Container Name:** NXOLand Frontend
   - **Target Platform:** Web
4. Accept terms
5. Copy your **Container ID** (format: `GTM-XXXXXXX`)

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variable

**Development Environment:**
```bash
# In nxoland-frontend/.env.development
VITE_GTM_ID=GTM-XXXXXXX  # Replace with your actual ID
```

**Production Environment:**
```bash
# In nxoland-frontend/.env.production
VITE_GTM_ID=GTM-XXXXXXX  # Replace with your actual ID
```

**Hostinger/VPS:**
- Add environment variable via hosting control panel
- Or add to deployment config

### Step 3: Configure GA4 in GTM

1. **Open GTM Console** → Your Container
2. **Click "Tags"** → **"New"**
3. **Tag Configuration:**
   - Click "Tag Configuration"
   - Select **"Google Analytics: GA4 Configuration"**
   - Enter your **GA4 Measurement ID** (G-XXXXXXXXXX)
     - Get this from [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/)
     - Admin → Data Streams → Your Stream → Measurement ID
4. **Triggering:**
   - Click "Triggering"
   - Select **"All Pages"**
5. **Save** the tag
6. **Name it:** "GA4 - Page Views"

### Step 4: Enable Enhanced E-commerce (Optional but Recommended)

1. In GTM Tag Configuration
2. **Fields to Set** → **Add Row**
   - Field Name: `send_page_view`
   - Value: `false` (we handle this manually)
3. Save

### Step 5: Test with GTM Preview

1. In GTM, click **"Preview"** button
2. Enter your site URL (development or staging)
3. A new tab opens with GTM debugger
4. Navigate your site and verify:
   - ✅ GTM container loads
   - ✅ GA4 tag fires on page views
   - ✅ Custom events appear (login, add_to_cart, etc.)
   - ✅ Device type is included in events

### Step 6: Publish GTM Container

1. Click **"Submit"** (top right)
2. Enter:
   - **Version Name:** "Initial GA4 Setup"
   - **Version Description:** "GA4 configuration with page views and e-commerce tracking"
3. Click **"Publish"**

### Step 7: Verify GA4 Data

1. Go to [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/)
2. Navigate to **Reports** → **Realtime**
3. Open your site in a new tab
4. Verify:
   - ✅ Active users appear
   - ✅ Page views are tracked
   - ✅ Events appear (scroll, click, custom events)
5. Wait 24-48 hours for full reporting to populate

### Step 8: Deploy to Production

**Build Frontend:**
```bash
cd nxoland-frontend
npm run build
```

**Deploy (Example for Hostinger):**
```bash
# Upload dist/ folder to public_html
# Or use FTP/SFTP
```

**Verify Environment Variable:**
- Check that `VITE_GTM_ID` is set in production
- GTM will only load in production builds

// Should be an array with events
console.log('dataLayer:', window.dataLayer);

// Check GTM container ID
console.log('GTM ID:', Object.keys(window.google_tag_manager)[0]);
```

### Trigger Test Event (Browser Console)
```javascript
// Test custom event
window.dataLayer.push({
  event: 'test_event',
  test_parameter: 'test_value'
});

// Check if it appears in GTM Preview
```

### Check Device Detection
```javascript
// Should return 'mobile', 'tablet', or 'desktop'
const getDeviceType = () => {
  const width = window.innerWidth;
  if (width < 768) return 'mobile';
  if (width < 1024) return 'tablet';
  return 'desktop';
};
console.log('Device Type:', getDeviceType());
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### GTM Not Loading
**Issue:** GTM script doesn't load in production

**Solutions:**
1. Check `VITE_GTM_ID` is set correctly
2. Verify environment is production (`npm run build`, not `npm run dev`)
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify no ad blockers are interfering
5. Check network tab for GTM script request

### Events Not Appearing in GA4
**Issue:** Events tracked but not in GA4

**Solutions:**
1. Wait 24-48 hours (standard reports lag)
2. Check Real-time reports instead
3. Verify GA4 Measurement ID in GTM is correct
4. Check GA4 tag is firing in GTM Preview
5. Ensure GA4 tag trigger is "All Pages"

### Device Type Not Tracked
**Issue:** `deviceType` parameter missing

**Solutions:**
1. Check GTM dataLayer in console
2. Verify `getDeviceType()` function works
3. Check events include `deviceType` parameter
4. May need to create GTM variable for device type

### Console Errors
**Issue:** JavaScript errors related to GTM

**Solutions:**
1. Check GTM container is published
2. Verify GTM container ID is correct
3. Clear browser cache
4. Check for conflicting scripts
5. Review GTM container setup

- Always test in Preview mode before publishing
- Use descriptive tag and trigger names
- Document changes in version descriptions
- Monitor GTM regularly
- Keep GTM container organized with folders
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Add notes to complex configurations

### Don'ts ❌

- [ ] Update privacy policy to mention analytics
- [ ] Implement consent mode in GTM
- [ ] Provide opt-out mechanism
- [ ] Document data retention policies

### Cookie Consent Example
```typescript
// When user accepts cookies
window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
window.dataLayer.push({
  event: 'cookie_consent_update',
  consent_analytics: true,
  consent_marketing: true
});
```
