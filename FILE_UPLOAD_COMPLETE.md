   - Unique filename generation with UUID
   - File management (create, delete)
   - Max file size: 5MB
   - Supported formats: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP

2. **Upload Controller** (`upload.controller.ts`)
   - `POST /api/upload/product-image` - Single product image
   - `POST /api/upload/product-images` - Multiple images (max 10)
   - `POST /api/upload/avatar` - User avatar
   - `DELETE /api/upload/delete` - Delete single file
   - `DELETE /api/upload/delete-multiple` - Bulk delete
   - All endpoints protected with JWT authentication

3. **Upload Module** (`upload.module.ts`)
   - Configured and exported upload service
   - Integrated with ConfigService

4. **Static File Serving** (`main.ts`)
   - Serves uploaded files from `/uploads` directory
   - Accessible via `http://api.nxoland.com/uploads/...`

### Frontend (React)
