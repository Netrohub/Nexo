## 🚨 WHAT NEEDS FIXING (Priority Order)

### 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY (Do Before Launch)

#### 1. Add Database Indexes (30 minutes)
**Impact:** 🚀 Massive performance improvement  
**Difficulty:** Easy

```sql
-- Add these indexes to Prisma schema:
@@index([seller_id])      // Products by seller
@@index([category_id])    // Products by category  
@@index([user_id])        // Cart & Wishlist queries
@@index([status, created_at]) // Order queries
```

**Why:** Without these, queries will be slow as data grows.

---

#### 2. Verify GTM Tracking (1 hour testing)
**Impact:** 📊 Ensure analytics data is accurate  
**Difficulty:** Easy

**Action:**
1. Open GTM Preview mode
2. Navigate through app (especially SPA routes)
3. Verify page views fire on each route change
4. Check that device_type is captured

**Current Status:** Code looks correct, just needs production verification.

---

### 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY (First Week After Launch)

#### 3. Create Backend .env.example (15 minutes)
**Impact:** 📝 Better documentation  
**Why:** Helps with deployment and onboarding

---

#### 4. Remove Unused Imports (5 minutes)
**File:** `App.tsx` line 6
```typescript
// Remove: RouterProvider, createBrowserRouter
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";
```

---

#### 5. Add Enhanced E-commerce Tracking (2 hours)
**Impact:** 📈 Better conversion tracking

**Events to Add:**
- `begin_checkout`
- `add_payment_info`
- `add_shipping_info`

---

### 🟢 LOW PRIORITY (Future Enhancements)

6. Dynamic meta tags for SEO (React Helmet)
7. Image optimization (WebP + srcSet)
8. Bundle analyzer
9. Service Worker / PWA
10. Performance monitoring (Sentry)
