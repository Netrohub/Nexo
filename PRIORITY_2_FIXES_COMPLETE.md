## 2. ✅ Fixed Orders Management

### Changes Made:

    - Uses correct endpoint: `POST /admin/disputes/:id/assign`
    - Requires admin selection before assignment
    - Proper error handling

  - **Resolve Dispute Dialog:**
    - Resolution notes textarea
    - Uses correct endpoint: `PUT /admin/disputes/:id/status`
    - Sends `{ status: 'RESOLVED', resolution: string }`
    - Allows adding resolution details

- Added admin users query to populate selection dropdown
- Fixed endpoint usage:
  - Assign: `POST /admin/disputes/:id/assign` with `{ admin_id: number }`
  - Resolve: `PUT /admin/disputes/:id/status` with `{ status: 'RESOLVED', resolution: string }`
- Added `refetch()` calls after successful operations
- Improved error handling

  - Transaction Reference input (required)
  - Description textarea (optional)

- Fixed Process Payout functionality:
