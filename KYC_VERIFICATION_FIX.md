# KYC Verification Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Frontend Not Receiving Correct Verification Status
**Problem**: The frontend was checking for `user?.emailVerified`, `user?.phoneVerified`, and `user?.kycStatus` fields that were not being returned by the backend.

**Root Cause**: The backend `getCurrentUser` method was returning raw Prisma user data without transforming it to match the frontend's expected format.

**Solution**: Modified `nxoland-backend/src/auth/auth.service.ts` to transform the user data before returning:
- Added `emailVerified: !!user.email_verified_at` (boolean)
- Added `phoneVerified: !!user.phone_verified_at` (boolean)
- Added `kycStatus: kycStatus.identity ? 'verified' : 'incomplete'` (string)

### 2. Verification Status Not Persisting
**Problem**: After completing verification steps, the status was not persisting after page refresh.

**Root Cause**: 
1. Frontend was calling `updateKYCStatus('email', true)` which called a non-existent endpoint `/kyc/email`
2. No timestamp fields were being set in the database
3. Frontend verification status was based on database fields that weren't being populated

**Solution**: 
1. Changed frontend to call `refreshUser()` after verification instead of `updateKYCStatus()`
2. Backend now properly sets `email_verified_at`, `phone_verified_at`, and `identity_verified_at` timestamps
3. The transformed `getCurrentUser` response now includes `emailVerified` and `phoneVerified` boolean fields

### 3. Complete KYC Status Flow

#### Email Verification:
1. User clicks "Send Verification Code" → `POST /kyc/send-email-verification`
2. Backend generates 6-digit code and stores in `kyc_status.emailCode`
3. Email sent with code via SMTP
4. User enters code → `POST /kyc/verify-email`
5. Backend verifies code and sets `email_verified_at` timestamp
6. Frontend calls `refreshUser()` to get updated status
7. Status persists in database: `email_verified_at` field set

#### Phone Verification (TODO):
Currently placeholder - shows "Phone verification is coming soon!"
When implemented, should:
1. Send SMS code to user's phone
2. Verify code and set `phone_verified_at` timestamp
3. Frontend calls `refreshUser()` to get updated status

#### Identity Verification (Persona):
1. User clicks "Start Identity Verification" → opens Persona popup
2. Persona completes verification and sends webhook → `POST /kyc/webhooks/persona`
3. Backend updates `kyc_status.identity = true` and sets `identity_verified_at`
4. Frontend calls `refreshUser()` to get updated status

## Changes Made

### Backend (`nxoland-backend/src/auth/auth.service.ts`):
```typescript
async getCurrentUser(userId: number): Promise<User> {
  // ... fetch user from database ...
  
  // Transform user data for frontend
  const kycStatus = typeof user.kyc_status === 'string' 
    ? JSON.parse(user.kyc_status) 
    : (user.kyc_status || {});
  
  return {
    ...userWithoutPassword,
    emailVerified: !!user.email_verified_at,
    phoneVerified: !!user.phone_verified_at,
    kycStatus: kycStatus.identity ? 'verified' : 'incomplete',
  } as User;
}
```

### Backend (`nxoland-backend/src/kyc/kyc.service.ts`):
- `verifyPhone`: Now sets `phone_verified_at` timestamp
- `handlePersonaCallback`: Now sets `identity_verified_at` timestamp

### Frontend (`nxoland-frontend/src/pages/account/KYC.tsx`):
- Changed from calling `updateKYCStatus()` to calling `refreshUser()`
- This fetches fresh user data from backend after each verification step

## Database Schema

The `users` table has these verification-related fields:
- `email_verified_at`: DateTime (set when email verified)
- `phone_verified_at`: DateTime (set when phone verified)
- `identity_verified_at`: DateTime (set when Persona verification completes)
- `kyc_status`: JSON field containing `{email: bool, phone: bool, identity: bool}`
- `kyc_verified`: Boolean (set when all steps complete)

## Testing

1. **Email Verification**:
   - Send verification code → check email arrives
   - Enter code → should see success message
   - Refresh page → status should persist (shows "Email Already Verified")

2. **Phone Verification**:
   - Currently placeholder (TODO: implement SMS verification)

3. **Identity Verification**:
   - Start Persona verification
   - Complete in Persona popup
   - Refresh page → status should persist

## Deployment

Backend changes have been pushed to repository. Deploy using:

```bash
cd nxoland-backend
git pull
npm install
npm run build
pm2 restart nxoland-backend
```

Frontend changes are already deployed (pushed to repository earlier).

## Notes

- Phone verification is currently a placeholder and needs SMS integration
- All verification statuses now persist correctly in database
- Frontend correctly reads verification status from database
- No more "status disappears after refresh" issue
